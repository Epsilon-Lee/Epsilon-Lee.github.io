In [1], the author first reflects on AlexNet as a modified LeNet with *more layers, better weight init. activation functions and data augmentation*.

> "In fact, Alex Krizhevsky's former colleagues recall that many meetings before the competition consisted of Alex describing his progress with the CUDA quircks and features."

> "I believe a significant factor was the emergence of the second generation of general-purpose ML frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch."

The author listed several requirements for his willing next-generation ML toolkits:

1. Fine-grained control flow use;
2. Non-standard optimization loops;
3. Higher-order differentiation as a first-class citizen;
4. Probabilistic programming as a first-class citizen;
5. Support for multiple heterogeneous accelerators in one model;
6. Seamless scalability from a single machine to gigantic clusters;
