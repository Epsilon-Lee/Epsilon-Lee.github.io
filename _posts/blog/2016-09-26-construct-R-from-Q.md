Announcement: This is reading notes excerpted from Walter Rudin's **Principles of Mathematical Analysis**, from Chapter one, with special attention on how to construct $\mathbb{R}$ from $\mathbb{Q}$. This question arised with a theorem's proof in the book **Probability Essentials** presented as below. 

> **Theorem 2.1.**
> The Borel  $\sigma$-algebra of  $\mathbb{R}$ is generated by intervals of the form $(-\infty, a]$, where $a \in \mathbb{Q}$ ($\mathbb{Q}$ = rationals).

#### 1. The proof of $\sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number

So first of all, what is a rational number. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number">wikipedia</a>, a rational number is any number that could be represented as the quotient or fraction of two integers, $\frac{p}{q}$. Although, as a causalist, this leads me to question 'What is an integer?', we here not care about its mathematical rigor and assume the axiomatic result. 

So to prove $\sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number, means to prove that $\sqrt{2}$ can not be expressed as the form $\frac{p}{q}$. We use proof by contradiction here: 

> **Proof.** 
>
> Suppose $\sqrt{2}$ can be expressed as $\frac{p}{q}$. More formally, the assumption can be written as: $\exists p, q \in \mathbb{Z}, \sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}$. Then, $\sqrt{2} q = p \Rightarrow 2q^2 = p^2$. So there exits p, q such that $2p^2 = q^2$ holds. When problem reduces to equation of integers, the use of parity is always turned to. If q is odd, so does $q^2$, the equality will not hold, since the left-hand side of the equal should be even. So q is even. Let $p = 2^{i}k$, $q=2^{j}l$, where $k, l$ are odd and $j > 0$. According to the equality, we have: $2 * 2^{2i}k^2 = 2^{2j}l^2$. That is: $2^{2i+1-2j}k^2 = l^2$. It is impossible, since $k, l$ are odd, and $2i+1-2j \ne 0$. So the assumption is not true. $\square$

#### 2. Ordered Set, (Least) Upper Bound, (Greatest) Lower Bound

> **Def. Order.** an order is a relation $R=\{<,=,>\}$ over a set, such that only three specific relationships hold between any x and y in the set and each of them is transitive, denoted as $xRy$.

So an Ordered Set $S$ is a set where an order is defined. Since $S$ is an ordered set, we could define bounds for its subset $E \subset S$. If there exists $\beta \in S$ such that $x \le \beta$ for every $x \in E$, we say that $E$ is bounded above and $\beta$ is an **Upper Bound** of $E$. Lower can be defined similarly.

Moreover, if for any $\gamma < \beta$ and $\gamma \in S$, $\gamma$ is not an upper bound of $E$, then $\beta$ is the **Least Upper Bound** of set $E$, which is denoted as $\beta$ = sup$E$. Greatest lower bound can be defined in the similar way, and is denoted by $\beta$ = inf$E$

An ordered set $S$ is said to have **least-upper-bound property** if for any subset $E \in S$ and $E \ne \phi$, if $E$ is bounded above, then $E$ has its least upper bound $\beta$ = sup$E \in S$. Then we could have a theorem that connects the relationship between least upper bound and greatest lower bound.

> **Theorem.**
>
> Suppose $S$ is a set that has least-upper-bound property. If $E \in S$ is bounded below and we denote all possible lower bounds of $E$ as a set $L$. According to the least-upper-bound property of $S$, suppose the least uppper bound of $L$ is $\alpha$ = sup$L$. Then we have: $\alpha$ = inf$E$.

#### 3. Field and Ordered Field

> **Def. Field.** A field is a set $F$ with two operations, i.e. addition, multiplication, which satisfies the following field axioms: 
>
> - (A) Axioms for addition
>
>   - (A1) If $x, y \in F$, then their sum $x + y \in F$.
>   - (A2) Addition is commutative, i.e. $x + y = y + x$.
>   - (A3) Addition is associative, i.e. $x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z$.
>   - (A4) $F$ contains an element 0 such that $0 + x = x$ for every $x \in F$.
>   - (A5) To every $x \in F$ corresponds an element  $-x \in F$ such that $x + -x = 0$.
>
> - (M) Axioms for multiplication
>
>   - (M1) If $x, y \in F$, then their sum $x y \in F$.
>   - (M2) Addition is commutative, i.e. $x y = y  x$.
>   - (M3) Addition is associative, i.e. $x  (y  z) = (x  y)  z$.
>   - (M4) $F$ contains an element 1 such that $1  x = x$ for every $x \in F$.
>   - (M5) To every $x \in F$ corresponds an element  $1/x \in F$ such that $x  (1/x) = 1$.
>
> - (D) Distributive Law  
>
>   - $$x(y + z) = xy + xz$$ holds for all $x, y, z \in F$.
