**Criticism of Bayesian**

- [Carles Gelada's criticism on Bayesian NN on Twitter](https://twitter.com/carlesgelada/status/1208618401729568768).

  - **Neil Lawrence**'s comment on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lawrennd/status/1218823645746909185), and his previous comment on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lawrennd/status/1210636300258332672).

    - Marginal likelihood $$\Rightarrow$$ True model, which is *subjective* (according to certain prior)

    - > "I don't think the prior is the important part, it's just a route to writing down the marginal likelihood which is the important part"
