- [Learning Hierarchical Discrete Linguistic Units from Visually-Grounded Speech](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1elCp4KwH), ICLR 2020.
  - They present a method for learning discrete linguistic units via vector quantization (with VQ layers)
  - Relates speech units to word-level/sub-word level units
  - instead of reconstruction loss $$\Rightarrow$$ discriminative, multimodal grounding obj.
