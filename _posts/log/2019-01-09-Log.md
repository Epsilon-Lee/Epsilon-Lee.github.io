### [11:10]

Deploy my research log publicly, imitating [Jacob Steinhardt's](https://makingshitwork.wordpress.com/) out-of-date `Making Shit Work`. This is a long term effort (I hope I can insist on, since Jacob haven't even insisted between 2015 and 2016) to demonstrate my research career during PhD. 

> As I believe, a big research question or a great research issue can be decomposed into daily effort dots that can be reacheable and instantiable. A good researcher can carry out a series of connections in parallel and does not lose a brighter goal of approching the issue or developing the fundamentals behind.

Plan the day. 

[1:00] Write and debug code about freq. based prototyping. 

[1:00] Design and ensure several hyperparam setting, tune baseline Transformer upon IWSLT dataset (en-de, zh-en). 

[1:00] Think about how to test the compositionality of NMT model. 

[1:00] Read SSMT (Syntax-based Statistical Machine Translation): Ch1-2. 

[0:40] Think about edit-distance or optimal transport as a discrete translation operator between two monolingual sentences $$\mathbb{x}_1 \rightarrow \mathbb{x_2}$$ and Bitext pairs  $$(\mathbb{x}_1, \mathbb{y}_1) \rightarrow (\mathbb{x}_2, \mathbb{y}_2)$$. PS: chat with Qian about the **tools** for post edit analysis. 

[0:40] After read SSMT, try to derive the degree of abstraction w.r.t. the certain aspect of generalisation.
