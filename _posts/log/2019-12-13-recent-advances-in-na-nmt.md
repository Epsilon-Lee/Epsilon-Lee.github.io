### Papers in summary

#### The original paper

[Non-Autoregressive Neuran Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02281.pdf) (ICLR 2018) is the recent *biggest* (for me) innovations in Neural Machine Translation (NMT). It is a new modelling approach for the label dependency of NMT, which in essence assumes no label depedency among target words. This can accelerate inference time or decoding about several times faster than the classic auto-regressive counter part, and can potentially resolve several issues regarding auto-regressive structure, such as **exposure bias**.

> Note that, the implementation of several papers as well as the this original paper and the newest Levenstein Transformer are all implemented [here](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/fairseq/models/nat) in `fairseq`.

$$
p_{\mathcal{N}\mathcal{A}} = 
\sum_{f_1, f_2, \dots, f_{T'}}
\Bigg(
\Pi_{t'=1}^{T'} p_F (f_{t'} \vert x_{1:T'}; \theta)
\cdot
\Pi_{t=1}^{T} p(y_t \vert x_1 \{f_1\}, \dots, x_{T'} \{f_{T'}\})
\Bigg)
$$

The above equation is the factorized probabilistic model for the translation conditional $$p(y \vert x)$$. For inference, the author define:

$$Y = G(x_{1:T'}, f_{1:T'})$$

to represent the optimal translation given a source sentence and a sequence of fertility values. And since marginalizing all the fertility sequences is intractable, so the authors adopt three strategies:

- $$\arg\max$$ inference under the fertility model $$p_{F}(f_{t'} \vert x_{1:T'}; \theta)$$;
- $$\text{avg}$$ inference over the fertility model;
- **Noisy parallel decoding (NPD)**: add noise to sampling $$s \in \{10, 100\}$$ different fertility sequences, and then choose the one with largest $$\Pi_{t=1}^{T} p(y_t \vert x_1\{f_1\}, \dots, x_{T'}\{f_{T'}\})$$ value.

The actual training loss are two terms emerges using variational inference to approximate the over the above equation via a proposal distribution $$q(f_{t'} \vert x_{1:T'}, y_{1:T})$$ which can reach the information from both source and target.

$$
\begin{align}
\log \sum_{f_{1:T'} \sim p_F(f_{1:T'} \vert x_{1:T'}; \theta)} p(y_{1:T} \vert f_{1:T'}, x_{1:T'}; \theta) &= \log \sum_{f_{1:T'} \sim q(f_{1:T'} \vert x_{1:T'}, y_{1:T})} p(y_{1:T} \vert f_{1:T'}, x_{1:T'}) \frac{p_F}{q} \\
& \geq \mathbb{E}_{q} (\log p + \log p_F/q) \\
& = \sum_{f_{1:T'} \sim q} \log p(y_{1:T} \vert x_{1:T'}, f_{1:T'}; \theta) + \sum_{f_{1:T'} \sim q} \log p_F(f_{1:T'} \vert x_{1:T'}; \theta) + \mathcal{H}[q] 
\end{align}
$$

**Sequence-level Knowledge Distillation**

To reduce dataset modality (one-to-many for specific), sequence-level knowledge distillation is used to construct a new corpus by training an autoregressive machine translation model, known as the teacher, to greedily outputs the target for each source training example.

> "The resulting targets are less noisy and more deterministic, as the trained model will consistently translate a sentence like 'Thank you.' into the same German translation every time."

For a better understanding of the important role of knowledge distillation in NAT training, Jiatao's group has another paper [7] submitted to ICLR 2020.

[TO-DO: a brief summary of that paper]

**Fine-tuning with word-level distillation**

This process is conducted for improving the coupling (cooperation) between the fertility model and the translation model by exposing to the fertility model's own action sequence. The reward signal is measured by the following loss term:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{RKL}} (f_{1:T'}; \theta)
=
\sum_{t=1}^{T} \sum_{y_t} \log p_{\mathcal{AR}} (y_t \vert x, \hat{y}_{1:t-1})
\cdot
p_{\mathcal{NA}}(y_t \vert x, \hat{y}_{1:t-1})
$$

Since $$\hat{y}$$ is generated by the non-autoregressive model, so evaluation on it like the word-level cross-entropy can measure the usefulness of the fertility sequence with in terms of generating sequence similar to the autoregressive model. Here the authors still do not use the original reference $$y^*$$ to calculate reward, still due to the modality consideration. For controlling variance, a baseline is also introduced which is the expected fertility sequence predicted through averaging.

Let us see the code for detailed implementation. The naive `nonautoregressive_transformer` (`NATransformerModel`) model is inherited from `FairseqNATModel`, which is also inherited from `TransformerModel`.

```python
NATransformerModel
-> FairseqNATModel
-> TransformerModel
-> FairseqEncoderDecoderModel
-> BaseFairseqModel
-> nn.Module
```

The `NATransformerModel` is built through the `def build_model()` function in `TranslationLevenshsteinTask -> TranslationTask -> FairseqTask`, which calls the `def build_model()` function in the `models` folder (python module), which in the end calls the `def build_model()` function in `TransformerModel`. This creates the encoder and decoder separately.

```python

#### Block-wise modeling

[Blockwise Parallel Decoding for Deep Autoregressive Models](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8212-blockwise-parallel-decoding-for-deep-autoregressive-models.pdf) (NeurIPS 2018), comes after Jiatao Gu's work, and also focuses on the modelling of target word dependency or label dependency. Their main claimed contribution is *also* speed.

> "This allows for substantial theoretical improvements in generation speed when applied to architectures that can process output sequence in parallel."

Their initial speed up is $\times 2$, without loss of performance for NMT compared to a greedy non-parallel autoregressive decoder.

> One common feature among recent architectures such as the Transformer and convolutional sequence-to-sequence models is an increased capacity for parallel computation. [...] While advances in this direction have allowed for significantly faster training, outputs are still generated one token at a time during inference, [...] in light of this limitation, a growing body of work is concerned with different approaches to accelerating generation for autoregressive models.

**Block-wise parallel decoding mechanism**

Given the decoding history $$y_{1:t}$$, if we have $$k$$ specialized parameterization $$p_i(y_{t+i} \vert y_{1:t})$$ for predicting $$y_{t+1}$$, $$y_{t+2}$$, ..., $$y_{t+k}$$ with $$i=1...k$$, we can predict $$k$$ words independently in a parallel way.

Then the authors come up with the following procedure for reliably inference with a more delicate **verify** and **accept** stages.

- **Predict**: use the $$k$$ parameterizations to predict $$k$$ greedy output tokens;
- **Verify**: each independently predicted word is compared with the greedy normal autoregressive model's prediction, if they are agreed, accept that word and move on to the next parallel predicted word for judging its acceptance:
  - $$\hat{y}_{t + i} = \arg \max p_1 (y_{t + i} \vert \hat{y}_{\leq t+i-1}, x)$$
- **Accept**: extend $$\hat{y}$$ with $$\hat{y}_{t+1}, \dots, \hat{y}_{t+\hat{k}}$$.

![parallel_decoding_illustration](_posts/log/fig/parallel_decoding_illustration.png)

> **The most important note.**
>
> "The potential of this scheme to improve decoding performance hinges (depends on) crucially on the ability of the base model $$p_1$$ to execute all prediction made in the verify substep in parallel"

**Architectural change**

Since the model is supposed to generate <u>a block of words</u> instead of a single word at each decoding step, so the decoder architecture is modeled with a multi-out structure shown in the following figure.

![parallel_decoding_decoder_arch_each_timestep](_posts/log//fig/parallel_decoding_decoder_arch_each_timestep.png)

Similarly, there is an concurrent work from Alibaba Research Group named "Semi-autoregressive Neural Machine Translation" [8], who use similar block-wise decoding strategy but **without verification**.

**The reality of model invocation**

Although the multi-out model can be executed only once for the $$k$$, but the verification model should be executed in parallel for $$k$$ for once, that is there should be $$k$$ copies of the $$p_1$$ model in GPU memory. 

[TO-DO: This part does not make too much sense to me.] 

**Relaxing verification conditions**

- Top-$$k$$ selection: if the parallel decoded words are in the top-$$k$$ word set of the $$p_1$$ greedy verifier, we accept the word;
- Distance-based selection: in image domain, the output and the greedy output have a natural distance, use a threshold to accept predictions within certain distance;
- Minimum block size: at least accept $$l$$ words;

> **Note.**
>
> To note that both semi-autoregressive Transformer [8] or this parallel decoding method can **only** be adapted to <u>self-attention mechanism</u> since RNN cannot compute context representations simultaneously for every time step.



#### Insertion-based modeling

#####  Insertion Transformer

[Insertion Transformer: Flexible Sequence Generation via Insertion Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03249) (ICML 2019 with [poster](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mitchell/files/icml-2019_poster_insertion-transformer.pdf)), has the same author with the [Block-wise decoding](#block-wise-decoding) paper previously summarized**.**

> **TLDR**
>
> This paper proposes a new modeling method for $$p(y \vert x)$$ as the factorization among content ($$c=\text{'cat'}$$ ) and location ($$l=2$$) as $$p(c, l \vert x, \hat{y}_t)$$, where the $$\hat{h}_t$$ denoting the decoding history of all tuples $$(c, l)$$ till time-step $$t$$; by proposing architectural modification from the original Transformer (Sec. 3.1) and several **label ordering** strategies (e.g. balanced binary tree) for constructing prefix $$\hat{y}_t$$ for loss calculation (Sec. 4) as well as parallel decoding during inference, they can train their proposed model variants up-to 27.41 BLEU score on WMT14 En-De (comparable with Transformer base). As its biggest contribution, their **parallel decoding** have an ideally $$\log n$$ complexity (decoding steps/iterations) compared to the common left-to-right modeling. Moreover, **EOS penalty** as a margin between the eos token and the second-largest-probability token $$\beta$$ is very essential to the performance success (contributing to 4 BLEU scores the most).

![insertion_transformer](_posts/log/fig/insertion_transformer.png)

The above figure are the two decoding modes, i.e. greedy (sequential) decoding and parallel decoding. Following are two examples for the balanced binary tree label (target) generation order in parallel decoding mode and for greedy decoding mode (with uniform loss):

##### Insertion-based generative sequence model

[KERMIT: Generative Insertion-based Modeling for Sequences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01604.pdf), arXiv June 4 2019, comes after the [Insertion Transformer](#insertion-transformer), the same author proposes a "more general" framework for insertion-based modeling. The authors starts from the most general joint distribution $$p(x, y)$$, which is modeled to be easily marginalized for unpaired training (monolingual [!?] training) for enhancing its marginal distributions.

> KERMIT stands for Kontextualized Encoder Representation Made by Insertion Transformations.

In essence, KERMIT resembles BERT and all other holistic seq2seq models (e.g. masked language model) who use a shared parameterization of the encoder and the decoder.



##### Insertion-based decoding with flexible generation order

[Insertion-based Decoding with automatically Inferred Generation Order](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01370.pdf), arXiv Feb. 2019, comes after Jiatao Gu's seminal [NAT](#the-original-paper) paper with the same author. Different from the following [Levenshtein Transformer](#levenshtein-transformer) paper, this paper mainly focus on discussing the generation order of the target labels $$y=(y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n)$$ based on the **insertion** action instead of deletion or substitution as discussed below.

![insertion_flexible_order_illustration](/fig/insertion_flexible_order_illustration.png)

As shown in the above figure, the insertion mechanism is very similar to [3]. The beginning canvas only have `<s>` and `</s>` symbols and the first word is inserted at the first position in between, and the following words are inserted in between previously generated words.

Same with [3], the insertion order should follow certain principles to ease learning via **pre-defined generation orders**.



##### Levenshtein Transformer

[Levenshtein Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11006.pdf) is also from Jiatao Gu at this year's NeurIPS conference.

Beyond insertion, this paper also models deletion operation as another global action during inference for not only flexible (insertion) but also, as the authors emphasize in the abstract, amenable (deletion) decoding policy. This allows dynamic length change, which is the most distinguishing feature compared to all above works which assume a *monotonic* generation history. The authors confirm the model's flexibility by validating the model trained on <u>translation task</u> can be directly re-purposed for the <u>post-editing task</u>. They claim comparable performance to the traditional left-2-right Transformer on both machine translation and text summarization.

**The underlying framework - MDP**

**Two actions: deletion & insertion**
