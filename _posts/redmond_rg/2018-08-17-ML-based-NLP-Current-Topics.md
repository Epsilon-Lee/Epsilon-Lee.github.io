> Since I am really interested in Machine Learning especially those related to strong statistical or math insight or guarantee, I would like to collect, according to my preference and taste, a list of current topics in NLP which have in-depth connection to learning-based background or thinking pattern. Look back into the history of NLP, data-driven methods has gradually governed most methods and played important role of the prosperity of the field, moreover it is those methods which have strong connections to the foundation of statistical learning that continually reshape and influence our thinking and problem solving pattern.
