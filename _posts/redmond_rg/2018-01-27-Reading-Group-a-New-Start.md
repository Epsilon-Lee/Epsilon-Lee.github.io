### 1. Welcome to Redmond's reading group

Welcome to the reading group blog post series of [Redmond Liu](https://lemaoliu.github.io/homepage/) at [Tencent AI Lab](http://ai.tencent.com/ailab/index.html). Currently, we have three lovely members:

- [Lemao (Redmond) Liu](https://lemaoliu.github.io/homepage/), senior researcher at Tecent AI Lab.
- [Charles Xin-Tong Li](https://znculee.github.io), research intern at Tencent AI Lab, PhD candidate at CUHK.
- [Guanlin (Epsilon) Li](https://epsilon-lee.github.io), research intern at Tencent AI Lab, PhD student at HIT.

### 2. Purpose and intention

The aim of this reading group is to broadly study about **recent trends** or **classics** in Statistics, Machine Learning, and other fields of Artificial Intelligence with an intention of shedding light on Computational Linguistics or Natural Language Processing. 

We hope to approach this area with systematically significant and possibly theoretically profound methodologies instead of parameter tuning, model hallucination, and naive feature engineering. We are really appealing to interesting works, ideas or directions. We focus mainly on several top conferences, namely:

- ICML, NIPS, AISTATS;
- ACL, EMNLP, NAACL;
- ICCV, CVPR, ECCV.

To broaden our eyesight, we will still put some emphasis over basic mathematical/learning formulations which are general to different problems or tasks, such as efficient deterministic or stochastic search or inference algorithms (greedy or dynamic programming, probabilistic inference), reinforcement learning, information theoretic interpretation, representation learning and non-parametric. 

### 3. Format

After each reading group meeting, we would like to write a summary blog post. The format should depend on the specific content that are discussed over, which could be tutorial-like, lecture-like, [review-like](http://www.inference.vc/), brain-storming-like, [trick-summary](http://blog.shakirm.com/) etc.

### 4. Contact

We are very open to welcome discussion. Formally, we could only be accessed through email at present. However, it is always nice if you write down comments through [disqus](https://disqus.com/) which is a plugin below the every blog post.
