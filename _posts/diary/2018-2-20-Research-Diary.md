- [Tensor Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04730). DL frameworks explores balance of usability and expressiveness. They operate on DAG of computational operators, wrapping high-performance libraries such as CUDNN for NVIDIA GPUs and NNPACK for various CPUs, and automatic memory allocation, synchronization, distribution. The **drawbacks** of existing frameworks are: newly-designed operations could not fit quickly into frameworks with high-performance guarantee.
