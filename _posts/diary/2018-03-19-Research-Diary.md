### Mar. 19

[11:33am] Reading the paper "Analyzing uncertainty in neural machine translation"

**Abstract**

- Some phenomenon related to current seq2seq nmt:
  - performance degradation with large beams;
  - under-estimation of rare words and a lack of diversity  in the final translations;
- Possible reasons:
  - **Extrinsic uncertainty**: noisy training data. 


### Mar. 22

There are several papers that from a information-theoretic view to deal with unsupervised word segmentation. 

- [An efficient algorithm for unsupervised word segmentation with branching entropy and mdl](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D10-1081), EMNLP 2010. 
- [Fully unsupervised word segmentation with BVE and MDL](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P11-2095), ACL 2011.
