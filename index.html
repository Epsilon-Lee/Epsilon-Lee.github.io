                        I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in <a href="http://en.hit.edu.cn/">Harbin Institute of Technology</a>. 
                        I love to understand phenomenon and imagine new stuffs in fields of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. 
                        I did my undergrad at <a href="http://english.ccnu.edu.cn/">Central China Normal University</a>, a beautiful university settled in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

                        <!--My interests lies in machine learning and deep learning; deep generative models and deep reinforcement learning in particular.
                        I worked on scalable bayesian machine learning and deep generative models during my undergrad.-->

                        <b>Research Interests</b> - I generally identify with the community that values reliable AI the most, and researches into both theoretiacal and empirical aspects of current data-driven paradigm of AI. More specifically, I am really interested in the following "friends" who I might have not got a chance to get along closely with:
		                <ul>
						  <li><b>Machine translation and multilinguality</b>
						  <!--p>
						  : machine translation is a well-defined problem/task, which has <i>relatively</i> realiable evaluation, so it could be one of the best venues to study frontier machine learning oriented problems and phenomenon such as calibration, general or out-of-distribution generalization ability, robustness, spurious correlation (shortcut), biases in terms of training dynamics, "knowledge" entailed in dataset, modelling options or assumptions (inductive bias). More recently, universal language representation and its emergence during pre-training become the main question of downstrem transfer learning between cross-lingual tasks. In terms of unsupervised representation learning, the disentanglement of language specific information from language-agnostic ones is under investigation.</li>
						  </p-->
						  <li><b>(Realistic) generalization and compositionality</b>
						  <!--p>
						  : generalization is one of the most fruitful and engaging mysteries of deep learning, but there lacks operational and formal (may not be mathematical) theory of realistic generalization due to our limited mathematical understanding of underlying real task. However, compositionality is a principle of the world as well as of language itself, though it might not cover 100% linguistic phenomenon (e.g. constructions in language), it might be an operational principle to be imposed upon current learning machines.	I see compositionality as a main component of realistic generalization and am eager to understand its power and limit of handling generalization. I think it is important to extend the traditional distributional view of generalization under the principle compositionality. Another promising approach to the realistic problem is to use certain formal language system to mimic language language, this can guarantee an accurate depiction of the underlying distribution of linguistic phenomenon so as to understand generalization in this controlled situation. However, how to design such delicate formal system is a piece of art.</li>
						  </p-->
						  <li><b>Interpretability</b>
						  <!--p>
						  : to approach the goal of reliable AI, interpretability in terms of both model and human user is urgent. Some key questions are: How to properly explain the model behavior to end user? Or how to identify and present causal explanation of model's decision to end user?</li>
						  </p-->
						</ul>
